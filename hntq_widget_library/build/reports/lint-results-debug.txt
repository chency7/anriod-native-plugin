E:\code\anriod-native-plugin\hntq_widget_library\src\main\res\layout\hitokoto_widget.xml:5: Warning: Possible overdraw: Root element paints background #333333 with a theme that also paints a background (inferred theme is @android:style/Theme.Holo) [Overdraw]
    android:background="#333333"
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "Overdraw":
   If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a
   custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme
   background will be painted first, only to have your custom background
   completely cover it; this is called "overdraw".

   NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated
   with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it's currently
   doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can
   incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then
   wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.

   If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should
   consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using
   that theme instead of a root element background.

   Of course it's possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you
   want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better
   performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that
   resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.

                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
E:\code\anriod-native-plugin\hntq_widget_library\build.gradle.kts:40: Warning: Use version catalog instead [UseTomlInstead]
    implementation("com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0")
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UseTomlInstead":
   If your project is using a libs.versions.toml file, you should place all
   Gradle dependencies in the TOML file. This lint check looks for version
   declarations outside of the TOML file and suggests moving them (and in the
   IDE, provides a quickfix to performing the operation automatically).

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
E:\code\anriod-native-plugin\hntq_widget_library\src\main\res\layout\hitokoto_widget.xml:30: Warning: Hardcoded string "— HNTQ", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]

E:\code\anriod-native-plugin\hntq_widget_library\src\main\res\layout\hot_search_widget.xml:40: Warning: Hardcoded string "正在获取热搜...", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
            android:text="正在获取热搜..."
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.

E:\code\anriod-native-plugin\hntq_widget_library\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml: Warning: The project references RTL attributes, but does not explicitly enable or disable RTL support with android:supportsRtl in the manifest [RtlEnabled]

   Explanation for issues of type "RtlEnabled":
   To enable right-to-left support, when running on API 17 and higher, you
   must set the android:supportsRtl attribute in the manifest <application>
   element.

   If you have started adding RTL attributes, but have not yet finished the
   migration, you can set the attribute to false to satisfy this lint check.
